The idea behind solving dutch national flag problem is that we start somewhere in the middle and then decide if that middle should be moved to the top of the list or to the end of the list by comparing the numbers. But we have to do that for every number in the list, that makes this a linear algorithm.

Time complexity: O(n) because we have to iterate through the whole list to make sure all numbers are checked
Space complexity: O(1) because no temporary collections are used
