In both and insert and search operation, we have to traverse through the path array once. Then, I  am using a dictionary inside every node to store children because we have to search the section of the path in the dict which is a O(1) operation.

For Both Insert and Search operations:
Time complexity: O(n) where n is the path array after splitting the route
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of elements in trie
