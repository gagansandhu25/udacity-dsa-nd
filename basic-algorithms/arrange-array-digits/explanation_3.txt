The implementation of this problem is pretty straight forward. If we have a sorted array in decending order then we can simply make the first number biggest by selecting even indexes and the other number by selecting odd indexes.

As we were not allowed to use python's sort function, I decided to use Merge Sort to achieve O(log(n)) for the sorting.

Then we just have to iterate through the list once which is O(n)

Time complexity: Sorting[O(log(n))] and Iteration O(n) = O(log(n))
Space complexity: O(n)
